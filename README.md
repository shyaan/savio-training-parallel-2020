# savio-training-parallel-2020
Materials for Savio parallel processing training on April 20, 2020.

The main document is `parallel.html` (or `parallel_slides.html` if you prefer a version that appears in slide-show format rather than as one long HTML page).

To directly view the HTML, please [click here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-parallel-2020/blob/master/parallel_slides.html).

If you're not familiar with Git or Github you can download the materials as a [zip file](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-parallel-2020/archive/master.zip)
